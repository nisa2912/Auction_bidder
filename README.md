# Auction_bidder(Ongoing)
An auction bidding site that lets the user create auctions and bid on other projects. Not complete.

For now, the user can login and view the gallery where all the other auctions are held. The admin panel is setup and the admin can create new auctions for the gallery.

The official documentation, although really well prepared, is not very beginner friendly, I found other resources on the web more helpful, like freecodecamp.
